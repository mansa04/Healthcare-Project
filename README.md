# 🧠 NLP-Based Automated Cleansing for Healthcare Data

A powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on **automating data cleansing in healthcare systems**. This tool leverages NLP techniques to detect, extract, and clean unstructured or inconsistent data, ensuring higher accuracy and standardization across healthcare records.

## 🏥 Project Overview

Healthcare data often contains noise, redundancy, typos, and inconsistencies, making it challenging to use for analysis, patient monitoring, and research. Our solution **automatically identifies anomalies**, **normalizes terminology**, and **standardizes** data using machine learning and linguistic patterns.

## 🔍 Features

- 🩺 Intelligent cleansing of patient records, clinical notes, and medical data
- 🧬 Named Entity Recognition (NER) for symptoms, diagnoses, and medications
- 🧹 Automatic removal of duplicates, typos, and irrelevant text
- 📊 Pre-processing pipeline for structured EHR integration
- ⚙️ Custom dictionaries and medical vocabulary support
- 🧠 Trained on healthcare-specific corpora for domain accuracy

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Flask (optional UI/API layer)
